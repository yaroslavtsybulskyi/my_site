**Welcome to the most epic Django project ever!** ðŸŽ‰

ðŸš€ What does it do?

It does something awesome (or will, once I figure it out). Right now, itâ€™s a solid foundation for a Django app with dynamic pages, proper routing, and some event wizardry.

How to run it?
```
git clone https://github.com/yaroslavtsybulskyi/my_site.git
cd my_site
```
Create and activate a virtual environment:
```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate 
```
On Windows use 
```
venv\Scripts\activate
```
Install dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Run the magic:
```
python manage.py runserver
```
Open your browser and enjoy at:
